                Education is the basic necessity of life. It is an integral tool that aids the overall
                growth and development. Education has a plethora of meanings and educates and empowers you within the
                four
                walls of the classroom as well as imbibe in your environment. Learning is an education that makes sense,
                and
                it needs awareness to reach the remote corners of the country.
                Education refers to ‘the process of providing and receiving instructions, through academic and
                scholastic
                efforts.’ Education is a process that begins at home. It differentiates humans from other living things.

                Education disciplines and develops both academic performances as well as curricular activities. A person
                learns to read, write, speak, practice activities, and learn various skills through Education. Education
                makes a person independent and self-sufficient.
                Education boosts and develops the commercial scenario as well as benefits the overall economy of the
                <!-- country. Higher the level of education, the better are the chances of development. Therefore, it is highly

                Educational reforms are the need of the hour…..
                <br>
                The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for
                India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should
                quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars,
                unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country
                like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education(
                somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
                <br>
                We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a
                21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…

                As a fundamental component of all academic programs, General Education is the foundation supporting
                student acquisition of skills in communication, analysis, mathematical reasoning, and synthesis. General
                Education provides students with transferrable skills that prepare them to gain knowledge, acquire new
                competencies, and broaden their perspectives so that they may better adapt to the needs of a changing
                society.
                <br>
                The learning experiences and assessments provided by our academic programs are built on the General
                Education goals, which are reflected in the College’s core requirements.
